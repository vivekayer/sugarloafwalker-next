          Sugar Loaf Walker was born in the spring of 2009. Writing music in
          Bethnal Green in London’s East End, I was looking to create an
          instrumental guitar sound, captured in melodies inspired by England.
          The Sugar Loaf Walk alleyway next to my flat gave the sound its name,
          and the first song I wrote was to become the first track on this
          album, The Late Summer. Over the coming months, I collaborated
          remotely with my brother, Arjun, in the US, who provided the
          imaginative bass guitar throughout this album. Finishing with some
          rudimentary drum tracks, I selected the songs, and made some CDs.
          Inspired by my mother-in-law Penny’s charming car license plate B9
          PNY, I named the demo Benign Penny, and shared the CDs with family and
          friends. As time moved on, I also moved on to other things, and left
          Sugar Loaf Walker behind.

          Fast forward to 2020 and the chaos of the pandemic gave way to the
          inertia of lockdown. Now living in Amman, Jordan, I rediscovered the
          demos while searching on my hard disk. The melodies of the songs
          inspired me to bring back Sugar Loaf Walker and finish the album,
          properly this time. The issue of the rudimentary drum tracks was
          solved through collaboration with Vinay, an excellent session drummer
          based in Chennai, my hometown in India where I grew up. The tracks
          were then remixed by Kevin, an incredible sound engineer based out of
          Portland, USA. Now I had a remote team bringing my original demos to
          life. I carefully picked ten songs and put them together in a way in
          which the listener could get lost.

          The album title, Benign Penny, now has a new and deeper meaning. We
          sadly lost my wonderful mother-in-law in 2010. However, my daughter
          was born in 2015, and took on the name Penny, keeping her
          grandmother’s spirit with her. The album cover, is a photograph of my
          daughter Penny when we lived in Bangkok, caught reaching out to the
          Fender Stratocaster that you can hear throughout this record. I hope
          you enjoy this musical journey.
