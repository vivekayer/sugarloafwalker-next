          Benign Penny: The Story Behind the Album
        </h2>
        <p className="section-subtitle"></p>
        <p className="section-subtitle">
          Sugar Loaf Walker was born in the spring of 2009. Writing music in
          Bethnal Green in London's East End, I was looking to create an
          instrumental guitar sound, captured in melodies inspired by England.
          The Sugar Loaf Walk alleyway next to my flat gave the sound its name,
          and the first song I wrote was to become the first track on this
          album, The Late Summer. Over the coming months, I collaborated
          remotely with my brother Arjun, in the US, whose imaginative bass
          guitar lines brought depth to the compositions. Finishing with some
          rudimentary drum tracks, I selected the songs, and made some CDs.
          Inspired by my mother-in-law Penny's charming car license plate B9
          PNY, I named the demo Benign Penny, and shared the CDs with family and
          friends. As time moved on, I moved on to other things and left
          Sugar Loaf Walker behind.

          Fast forward to 2020 and the chaos of the pandemic gave way to the
          inertia of lockdown. Now living in Amman, Jordan, I stumbled upon
          those old demos buried on a hard disk. The melodies of the songs
          inspired me to bring back Sugar Loaf Walker and finish the album,
          properly this time. The issue of the rudimentary drum tracks was
          solved through collaboration with Vinay, an excellent session drummer
          based in Chennai, my hometown in India where I grew up. The tracks
          were then remixed by Kevin, an incredible sound engineer based out of
          Portland, USA. Now I had a remote team bringing my original demos to
          life.

          The title Benign Penny took on a deeper meaning. We lost my wonderful
          mother-in-law, Penelope Ruth Corbett, in 2010. Five years later, my
          daughter was born and named Penny, carrying her grandmother's spirit
          forward. The album cover features a photograph of her in Bangkok,
          reaching out toward the Fender Stratocaster you hear throughout the
          record.

          This album is a musical journey that spans continents,
          generations, and memories. I hope you enjoy it.
